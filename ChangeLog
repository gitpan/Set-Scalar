	* Paul Schinder <schinder@pobox.com> reported that the set_set.t
	  subtest #5 produces "(a (b (a (c ...) ...)) (c ...))" for him,
	  not "(a (b (a ...)) (c ...))" as expected.  Nondeterminism
	  in stringification.  Not yet resolved but the test hacked
	  to allow either (for subtests #5 and #6).
	
	* Timothy Kimball <kimball@stsci.edu> reported that Set::Scalar 0.9
	  had the super/subsetness the wrong way round.  Fixed.

	* Set::Scalar 0.901 released.
