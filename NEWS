	After a LONG slumber the 0.004 is released.  It is really just a
	cosmetic release fixing a few warnings spewed by the newer releases
	of Perl (hey, 0.003 was written when dinosaurs and Perl 5.002 roamed
	the Earth) and also a "slight" problem with newer Perls (I don't
	know exactly when it started) or actually newer MakeMakers:
	the Scalar.pm would not get installed with "make install".  Ahem.

	If you are happily using 0.003, there is no need at all for you
	to upgrade.  But for example, if you upgrade to Perl 5.005 the
	0.003 may start giving warnings during runtime.  The 0.004
	should fix all such problems.

	Also: if you are a Set::Scalar user, you might be interested
	to know that I'm working with a really major release, 1.0.
	It will be a total rewrite, now that I am more fluent with
	Perl (I hope), so the new code should be clearer (it would be
	very hard to be any less clear...)  In any case the new
	release should be faster.
